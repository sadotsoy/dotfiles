# Dotfiles

Sadot Cortes <sadotsoy>

This is where I **archive** all my **configs** stuff, from all to all..
For now the more **active config files** are for **osx, nvim and fish**

There is a **(install script)[./install.sh]** where I automatized all the needed to setup my environment, be free to use it.
